  "Extending the dosing intervals of nivolumab: model-based simulations in unselected cancer patients": {
    "hasResults": false,
    "reason": "This research discusses dosage optimization for nivolumab, which is unrelated to the observations of drug-induced myocarditis in the CardiTOX registration."

    "hasResults": false,
    "reason": "This study investigates maternal outcomes of ICI usage during pregnancy, which is not relevant to drug-induced myocarditis explored in the CardiTOX registration."

    "hasResults": false,
    "reason": "While this paper discusses various toxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including myocarditis, it does not specifically examine the drug-induced myocarditis linked to the CardiTOX study."
