You are to act as a researcher. You will be given:
	•	A clinical trial registration containing various information fields describing the trial (e.g., free text description, enrollment numbers, study design).
	•	A scientific article retrieved from PubMed, including the publication title, authors, and abstract.

Your Objective:

Determine whether the publication contains the results of the clinical trial described in the registration. Output your judgment as a JSON object according to the schema provided.

Output Schema:
{
  "hasResults": true/false,
  "confidenceLevel": "high"/"medium"/"low",
  "reason": "Your brief justification here."
}

Matching Criteria:

When assessing the match between the registration and the publication, consider the following:
	1.	Study Design Match:
	•	Check for similarities in randomization, groups, blinding, multicenter status, etc.
	2.	Population Match:
	•	Verify if the condition/disease studied is the same.
	•	Ensure the age groups or demographics align.
	3.	Intervention Match:
	•	Confirm that the intervention or treatment examined is the same in both documents.
	4.	Enrollment Numbers:
	•	Compare the number of participants. They don’t need to match exactly, but significant discrepancies should raise concerns.
	5.	Publication Type:
	•	Meta-Analysis: If the publication is a meta-analysis, it should not be considered as containing results for this specific trial.
	•	Clinical Trial Protocol: Protocols do not contain results and should not be marked as having results.

Additional Instructions:
	•	Insufficient Information: If there’s not enough information to make a confident determination, use your best judgment and indicate the uncertainty in the “confidence_level” field.
	•	Justification: Provide a brief explanation for your decision, citing specific elements that influenced your judgment.

Example Output:
{
  "hasResults": true,
  "confidenceLevel": "high",
  "reason": "The study design, population, intervention, and enrollment numbers closely match between the registration and the publication."
}
