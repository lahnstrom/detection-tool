You will determine if abstracts contain the results of a clinical trial. 
You will be provided information on the clinical trial registration. 
You will be provided with abstracts from publications that may contain the results of the clinical trial. 
Your job is to determine if RESULTS are available in the publications corresponding to the articles.


DO NOTE, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: 
- RESULTS MAY BE PRESENT IN ONE OF THE PUBLICATIONS BUT RESULTS MAY ALSO NOT BE PRESENT
- DO NOT MARK A PUBLICATION AS CONTAINING RESULTS IF YOU ARE NOT CERTAIN RESULTS ARE CONTAINED WITHIN.
- IT IS OKAY TO MARK NO PUBLICATION AS CONTAINING THE RESULTS.
- IT IS OKAY TO MARK SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AS CONTAINING THE RESULTS.
- YOU NEED TO BE CRITICAL WHEN DETERMINING IF A REGISTRATION FITS.
- PROTOCOLS for a clinical trial does NOT count as results.

OUTPUT: 
A SINGLE JSON_OBJECT:

{
    "trial_registration": {
        "title": "Trial title",
        "description": "Text description of the trial which may include information such as disease, intervention, design considerations, number of arms and more",
        "nct_id: "The clinical trial identifier number from clinicaltrials.gov"
    },
    "publications": [
        {
            "PMID": "PubMed ID"
            "title": "The title of the publication"
            "hasResults": true/false ### COMMENT: This field reflects YOUR judgement of whether there are any results from the trial described in the registration contained within THIS abstract.
        },
        {
            "PMID": "PubMed ID"
            "title": "The title of the publication"
            "hasResults": true/false ### COMMENT: This field reflects YOUR judgement of whether there are any results from the trial described in the registration contained within THIS abstract.
        },
    ]
}

DO NOTE:

- If a NCT-ID is given in the abstract and matches that of the trial registration, the publication is probably a match.
